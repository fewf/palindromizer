What's a palindrome?

For our purposes it's a phrase wherein the letters going from left to right are exactly the same as the letters going from right to left. For instance, famously, "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama." Or with more fun punctuation: "No! Sir! Away! A papaya war is on!" 

Motivation:

Writing palindromes is hard, particularly ones that make at least a little sense in English. My strategy has been to start with a word that has some word or word piece in its reverse, put that in the center and work from there.

For example: *Cesspool* 's reverse is *loopssec* and that has the word *loops* in it.

So now we have "loops sec cesspool". Well, these are all words (sec is kind of a stretch, but it could be short for second, or it could be the Security Exchange Commission... work with me here.), but they don't make sense. Let's make "sec" into "secret":

loops sec*ret* cesspool

This makes maybe a modicum of sense grammatically, but it's not a palindrome... for that we gotta add "ter" between secret and cesspool.

So now we have:

loops secret *ter* cesspool.

Uhoh... "ter" is not a word. But "center" is!

loops secret *cen*ter cesspool.

Great but its not a palindrome anymore until we add:

loops secret *nec* center cesspool.

Let's make it:

loops secret nec*tar* center cesspool.

Once again non-palindromic, but we can add:

loops secret nectar *rat* center cesspool.

Well, this is a palindrome, and everything is a true word... but it doesn't make sense... We can lop off one of the middle "r"s, though and get:

loops secret nectar **at center cesspool.

It's almost a complete English sentence, but who loops secret nectar at center cesspool? Well, Bob does. because Bob's a palindrome.

*Bob* loops secret nectar at center cesspool. *Bob!*

Now it's complete, just waiting for a talented illustrator to figure what image this could be a caption for. Perhaps a detective hot on the trail of some abnormal sewage behavior realizes finally that Bob is looping into the septic system some odd juice at the central facility. And realizing, he repeats Bob's name like, A-Ha!

Anyway, Palindromizer will help you get from Cesspool to that palindrome faster. Type on either side and a stream of letters will be mirrored on the other side. Make changes to punctuation and spacing as needed without disturbing the other side. Need to erase that middle character, like the "r" in our example palindrome? Turn off Mirror Mode by pressing the "Mirror" button and erase away!
